				<h1>Brief History</h1></center><br />
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intramuros, also known as the "Walled City," is the historic core of Manila, Philippines. The area was first established in the late 16th century by Spanish conquistador, Miguel LÃ³pez de Legazpi, as a fortress to protect the city from foreign invaders. The walls were built to enclose the city and were made of stone and bricks, with several gates that served as entry points. The walls were also surrounded by a moat, making it almost impregnable.
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intramuros was the political, religious and cultural center of the Philippines during Spanish colonial rule. It was home to the Spanish government, the Catholic Church, and the homes of wealthy Spanish families. It also contained several important buildings, such as the Manila Cathedral, the Palacio del Gobernador, and the San Agustin Church, which still stand today and are popular tourist attractions. The walled city was also home to a diverse community, including indigenous Filipinos, Chinese, and Spanish. However, during WWII, Intramuros was heavily damaged by bombing, and many of the buildings were destroyed. Today, Intramuros has been rebuilt and restored, and it serves as a symbol of the Philippines' rich history and cultural heritage.</p>
